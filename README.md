# Heat Developer Kit (HDK)

Built real-time blockchain applications on HEAT with the HDK.

Write your blockchain applications in developer friendly TypeScript, add them to your local HEAT server `scripts` folder and expose your real time application to the world.

# One time setup

To get started writing HEAT applications you need to prepare your development environment, wheter you are developing on Linux, Mac or Windows the steps involved are roughly the same.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Microsoft Visual Studio Code is a __**free**__ and __**opensource**__ developer suite which we use to develop TypeScript applications.

We highly recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio Code for your TypeScript development since it works very well, is free, opensource and cross platform.

TypeScript however is a mature language and is supported by [many development tools](https://www.slant.co/topics/5815/~ides-for-typescript-development).

Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ to install Visual Studio Code.

### Clone HDK

To write HEAT applications you always start by cloning the HDK. The HDK comes with a collection of base libraries to make writing HEAT applications easier plus a collection of development tools that assist you compile, package and test your HEAT applications.

To clone the HDK to your local machine we use Git. Do the following to proceed.

```
# navigate to where you want to put your clone of the HDK
# now clone the HDK repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Heat-Ledger-Ltd/heat-dev-kit.git

# you can now find your private copy
$ cd heat-dev-kit
```
### Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. The HDK uses Node.js run it's compilation and package scripts.

NPM is the Node Package Manager, it's software tool that runs on Node.js and helps you install other Node.js packages.

If you don't have Node.js and NPM installed, install them now. Follow the link that matches your platform.
